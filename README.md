# Reporting Service

# Description

The reporting service generates .pdf reports based on information present in datasets.\
These datasets are required to conform to the OCSM (OpenAgri Common Semantic Model) as well as be JSON-LD compliant.

# Requirements
<ul>
    <li>git</li>
    <li>docker</li>
    <li>docker-compose</li>
</ul>

Docker version used during development: 27.0.3

# Installation

There are two ways to install this service, via docker or directly from source.

<h3> Deploying from source </h3>

When deploying from source, use python 3:12.\
Also, you should use a [venv](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/) when doing this.

A list of libraries that are required for this service is present in the "requirements.txt" file.\
This service uses FastAPI as a web framework to serve APIs, alembic for database migrations, fpdf2 for\
.pdf generation, sqlalchemy for database ORM mapping and pytest for testing purposes.

<h3> Pre commit hook </h3>

When working with repo after "requirements.txt" is installed \
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt (inside activated venv)
```
run:
```shell
pre-commit install
```

When pre-commit enabled and installed, after every commit ruff and black formatters \
will be activated to resolve formatting of python files.
<h3> Deploying via docker </h3>

After installing <code> docker </code> you can run the following commands to run the application:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The application will be served on http://127.0.0.1:80 (I.E. typing localhost/docs in your browser will load the swagger documentation)

<h3> Example usage </h3>

In order to create a report, you need data for that report.\
For this, there are two main APIs that are of significance:\
1. POST localhost/api/v1/openagri-dataset/
2. POST localhost/api/v1/openagri-report/{report_type}/dataset/{dataset_id}

The first one is used to upload a dataset to the service.\
It returns the ID of the dataset.

The second one is used to generate a .pdf report, it takes an *ID* of a dataset\
and a *type* of report and generates it if the service finds the required data\
inside the dataset.\
The type can be any one of:\
*[work-book, plant-protection, irrigations, fertilisations, harvests, GlobalGAP]*

For more examples, please view the swagger documentation.

# Testing
The reporting service offers two ways to test it out, using the suite of tests written in pytest, or using converter \
scripts that are present [here](https://github.com/openagri-eu/OCSM/tree/main/converters).

<h2>Pytest</h2>
Pytest can be run on the same machine the service has been deployed to by moving into the tests dir and running:

```
pytest tests_.py 
```

This will run the tests and return success values for each api in the terminal.

<h3>These tests will NOT result in generated .pdf files.</h3>

<h2>Script</h2>
There is also the farm_calendar_to_jsonld.py script, that can be run from the tests dir as well, with the following command:

```
python farm_calendar_to_jsonld.py ./example/datasets/example_farm_calendar.json
```

This command will then prompt the user for input. \
Any generated reports via this script will be placed inside the /tests/example/reports/ dir. \
The example raw dataset is transformed into the example_farm_calendar_AIM.jsonld file, that is OCSM compliant. \
This file is then used for generating reports, that can be seen in the reports dir.

<h3>These tests WILL result in generated .pdf files.</h3>
